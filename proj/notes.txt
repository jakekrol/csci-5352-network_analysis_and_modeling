The graph I generated on 03/27/2025 is clusters very well by sector 
- # of edges: ~100
- \deltat = 1
- added node metadata

do random graph generation
done: see rank2graph.py's cor2g_rand function

experiment 1:
    T = 1762
    try the following ts: 1 (daily), 5 (weekly), 20 (monthly), 60 (quarterly), 240 (annual)
    where each trading week has 5 days

    how to choose max m?
        for t=1, the correlation distribution is zero-inflated, can go until corr is less than 0.1
    ? what does corr dist look like for other t?
    or use 1 standard deviation above the mean of correlation distribution
    steps:
        - compute log return for each t
        - compute correlation matrix
        - compute correlation distribution
        - get mean and std of the distribution
        - choose m = mean + std
        - rank 

next steps:
    - do log return for t=5, 20, 60, 240
    - compute correlation matrix
    - compute correlation distribution
    - finish experiment 1

experiment 1:
let the t and m vary and measure (clustering coefficient [C], LCC size, # of components, mean degree, diameter, etc.)
steps:
1. see how I get corr matrix
    - price2cor.py
        - finds symbols with overlapping dates
        - computes a log return vector for t step (t=1) for now
        - computes correlation of the log return vectors
    - what are next steps?
    - write script to generate network from corr matrix
        - rank the correlations 
            - can use min heap to keep track of top k correlations
                - ex here: https://github.com/jakekrol/genefusion/blob/main/genefusion/genefusion/genefusion.py#L13-L30
                - maybe store as json {r1: {s_i: <symbol i>, s_j: <symbol j>, w: <corr>} ...}
    
problem: seems like some symbols are duplicated based 
on whether shareholders have voting rights or not
- let's choose the ones without voting rights
    - excluded symbols: GOOGL, FOXA, DISCA

idea: at each step track if the edge was drawn for
companies in the same sector

idea: plot the corr distribution for a given t
    - looks normally distributed for t=1

idea: plot the graph at m = 10, 1000, 10000

2. write script to compute G stats at various m
    - stats:
        - clustering coefficient [C]
        - LCC size
        - # of components
        - mean degree
        - diameter
3. next write a script for random graph
